# Maze Solver

## Overview

This exercise is designed to familiarize you with the basics of Prolog programming and logic programming by building a simple maze solver. The maze is represented as a list of facts in the form connected(X, Y), where X and Y are the coordinates of two adjacent cells in the maze. The goal is to write a Prolog program that can find a path from the start to the end of the maze.
Prerequisites

In order to complete this exercise, you will need:

   - A Prolog interpreter or development environment, such as SWI-Prolog or GNU Prolog
   - Basic knowledge of Prolog syntax and concepts, such as facts, rules, and queries

## Setup

   - Download or clone this repository to your local machine
   - Open the labirinto.pl file in your Prolog interpreter or development environment (it is generated in python)
   - Follow the instructions in the comments to write your Prolog program

## Exercise

The exercise consists of the following tasks:

   - Test and create your solution by issuing queries to the Prolog interpreter or development environment, developing some algorithm.
