# Prolog

## Overview

This exercise is designed to familiarize you with the basics of Prolog programming and logic programming by building a simple maze solver. The maze is represented as a list of facts in the form connected(X, Y), where X and Y are the coordinates of two adjacent cells in the maze. The goal is to write a Prolog program that can find a path from the start to the end of the maze.
Prerequisites

In order to complete this exercise, you will need:

   - A Prolog interpreter or development environment, such as SWI-Prolog or GNU Prolog
   - Basic knowledge of Prolog syntax and concepts, such as facts, rules, and queries

## Setup

   - Download or clone this repository to your local machine
   - Open the maze.pl file in your Prolog interpreter or development environment
   - Follow the instructions in the comments to write your Prolog program

Exercise

The exercise consists of the following tasks:

   - Define a Prolog rule path(X, Y) that represents a path from cell X to cell Y in the maze.
   - Define a Prolog rule solve(X, Y, P) that finds a path P from cell X to cell Y in the maze.
   - Test your solution by issuing queries to the Prolog interpreter or development environment, using the provided test cases.
